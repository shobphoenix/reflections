Q1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I guess the entire setup necessary for git to work takes place.


Q2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A working directory should contain all the files that we are working on, even the ones we don't want to commit or keep track of.
A repository is a set of all our commits unlike a staging area which is a temporary place to form a single commit. Once, we feel that a commit is good enough, we move it from the staging area to the repository.

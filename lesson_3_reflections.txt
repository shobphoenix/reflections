Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. When I want to share my work with other people.
2. When I want to create a backup repository for safe keeping.


Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Control.


Q3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A single repository contains multiple branches. Cloning is used to copy the entire repository. Fork is just like a clone, it just happens on GitHub.
Usage:
- Fork: When I want to work on other people's projects and don't have permission to modify their repository.
- Clone: When keeping a remote.
- Branches: I'll use this everytime I want to experiment with the codebase.


Q4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To get an idea about how far (in terms of modifications) we are from remote.
